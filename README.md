This project was completed as a part of the hackathon. 

This was my first time working in a team outside of my NSS class and it went fantastically. 

We build a simple code quiz app to teach kids entry level coding ideas. 

I personally handled a lot of the data handeling and connection functions throughout the page.

I was also respeonsible for a large portion of the CSS and executing the chosen theme of Pok√©mon.
